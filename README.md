# DSA-C-

## Overview
Welcome to the **DSA-C-** repository, a comprehensive collection of data structure and algorithm (DSA) implementations using **C++**. This repository is curated to help students, developers, and enthusiasts learn and practice various data structures and algorithms effectively.

### Author
**Hassan Jamshaid**

## Contents
This repository includes implementations for the following data structures and algorithms:

- **Lists**: Basic operations and implementations.
- **Stack**: LIFO structure with essential operations.
- **Queue**: FIFO structure with core functionalities.
- **Linked Lists**: Single and doubly linked list implementations.
- **Infix to Postfix/Prefix Conversions**: Converters with detailed explanations.
- **Trees**: Various tree structures and traversal methods.
- **Vectors**: Dynamic array implementations.
- **Maps**: Key-value storage with operations.
- **Hashing**: Implementations of hash tables.
- **Heaps**: Min-heap and max-heap implementations.
- **Graphs**: Graph representations and traversal algorithms.
- **Huffman Encoding**: Implementation of Huffman coding for data compression.

## Contribution
I will update this repository every month with new codes and algorithms to enhance the collection. Stay tuned for more implementations!
